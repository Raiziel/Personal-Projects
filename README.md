## Description
Generally, this is where I'll upload any of my own ideas that I may be working on or showcasing and exploring code that others have previously written so that I'm able to become more familiar with various programming techniques/problem solving. Sometimes, I may upload a project I'm working on and decide to revisit it for another time but I usually try to submit things that have substance and structure.
